Measuring Rotor temperature of any motor is difficult. As the rotor is continuously rotating and attaching any sensor to it would be difficult. Also, knowing the rotor's temperature would enable efficient control of the motor.

For this reason, predicting the rotors temperature using machine learning would benefit in designing of the motor with minimal equipment and helps in efficient control of the motor.
