### Predicting Rotor Temperature of a Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor(PMSM) using a Convolutional Neural Network(CNN)

The rotor temperature of any motor is difficult to measure as it is a rotating part. Placing any sensors to measure this difficult to measure temperature would result in increase in costs and also increase the weight of the motor. In the era of electric vehicles, electric drives have become common in automotives and a lot of research is ongoing to reduce the weight of the motors in order to increase the efficiency of electric cars.

Measurement of quantities like temperature, torque of the rotor is important in order to design control systems to effectively control the motor. Many statistical based approaches have been studied in estimating the values of temperatures and torque, but these approaches require domain knowledge and often are different for different motors and different operating conditions. There is no universal approach towards estimating these values.

With the advent of Deep Learning, methods have been proposed to use deep learning approaches to predict the sensor values. The goal of the project is to efficiently predict the rotor temperature of a permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM), as it is usually difficult to measure the rotor temperature. This kind of prediction helps to reduce the amount of equipment that is to be mounted on to the motor to measure the temperature.
