Gesture Recognition is an important application in many domains.
For example:
* In games, to enable the player to control game elements with hand
* In cars, for touch-less dashboards and enhanced safety
* In Language, identifying sign languages
* ...

In this project, I collected hand gesture images from my laptop's webcam and trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognize these gestures.

My future plan is to use the trained CNN in a game, to predict the hand gestures in real-time.
